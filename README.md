# Content++
A simplified and universal content management system.

# Why Content++ ?
Content Management Systems were supposed to:
  - Be simple. 
  - Do exactly what enterprises/users want.
  - Be efficient.
  - Be both - On-premises and Cloud deployable.
  - Be able to do more than just storing the content.
  - Seamlessly and easily move the content from one location/system to another (Not limited to - FileStorage, Database, FileNet, Alfresco, AWS, Azure, MongoDB etc)     


# Tech Stack:
  - Java 17
  - SpringBoot 3.x
  - Storage using: DB, NoSQLDB, FileNet, AWS S3, Azure Blob and Alfresco
  - Thymeleaf, Bootstrap5.x, SweetAlert2 and VanillaJS


# Centrally Manage Content Storage using :

# Extend the project further to integrate a simplified work-flow to empower Business Analysts to create Task(Work) Flows where different users belonging to different business units, based on their roles and privileges will be able to:
  - Trigger a Case (Work-Item).
  - View a Case (Work-Item) from respective business units. 
  - Lock/Unlock a Case (Work-Item). 
  - Modify a Case (Work-Item).
  - Approve a Case (Work-Item).
